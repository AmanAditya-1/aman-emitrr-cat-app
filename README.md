# Exploding Kitten Game

An interactive card game created with **ReactJS**, **Redux**, **Golang**, and **Redis**, inspired by the popular "Exploding Kittens" game. This application allows users to draw cards with a bit of suspenseâ€”avoid the bomb, defuse when needed, and try your luck!

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with randomized card draws.
- Smooth game state management with Redux.
- Backend logic implemented in Golang.
- Redis database used for real-time state storage and retrieval.
- Game restart and defuse mechanics to enhance gameplay.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Redux
- **Backend**: Golang
- **Database**: Redis

## Game Rules

1. **Cat Card**: If a cat card is drawn, it is removed from the deck.
2. **Exploding Kitten (Bomb)**: If the card is a bomb, the player loses the game immediately.
3. **Defusing Card**: Drawn defuse cards are removed from the deck. They can be used to defuse one bomb if drawn later.
4. **Shuffle Card**: If a shuffle card is drawn, the deck is refilled with 5 cards, and the game restarts.
